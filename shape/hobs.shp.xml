<abstract>This digital dataset defines the well locations for hydraulic-head observations used in the calibration of the transient hydrologic model of the Central Valley flow system. The Central Valley encompasses an approximate 50,000 square-kilometer region of California. The complex hydrologic system of the Central Valley is simulated using the USGSs numerical modeling code MODFLOW-FMP (Schmid and others, 2006).  This application is referred to here as the Central Valley Hydrologic Model (CVHM) (Faunt, 2009). Utilizing MODFLOW-FMP, the CVHM simulates groundwater and surface-water flow, irrigated agriculture, land subsidence, and other key processes in the Central Valley on a monthly basis from 1961-2003.  The USGS and DWR maintain databases of key wells in the Central Valley that are web-accessible (http://waterdata.usgs.gov and http://www.water.ca.gov/waterdatalibrary/, respectively). These data were combined to form a database of available water levels throughout the Central Valley from 1961 to 2003. More than 850,000 water-level altitude measurements from more than 21,400 wells have been compiled by the USGS or DWR and have been entered into their respective databases. However, only a small proportion of these wells have both sufficient construction information to determine the well-perforation interval and water-level measurements for the simulation period. For model calibration, water-level altitude data were needed that were (1) distributed spatially (both geographically and vertically) throughout the Central Valley, from the valley trough to the foothills; (2) distributed temporally throughout the simulation period (1961-2003); and (3) available during both wet and dry climatic regimes. From the available wells records, a subset of comparison wells was selected on the basis of perforation depths, completeness of record, climatic intervals, and locations throughout the Central Valley. Water-level altitude observations (19,725) for 206 comparison wells were used as calibration targets during parameter estimation.  The CVHM is the most recent regional-scale model of the Central Valley developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).The CVHM was developed as part of the USGS Groundwater Resources Program (see "Foreword", Chapter A, page iii, for details).</abstract>
<purpose>The well locations, perforated intervals, and time series of water levels are used as input to MODFLOW-FMP, the USGS 3-dimensional finite-difference code used to simulate flow in the CVHM.  In particular, the water-levels are used as observations to calibrate the model. The CVHM is a tool that accounts for integrated, variable water supply and demand, and simulates surface-water and groundwater-flow across the entire Central Valley system.</purpose>
<supplinf>The hydraulic-head observation dataset is one of many layers in a geospatial database supporting the USGS Central Valley Groundwater Availability Project. Regional groundwater availability studies quantify current groundwater resources, evaluate how those resources have changed through time, and provide tools that decision makers can use to predict system responses to future development and climate variability and change. To provide information to stakeholders addressing these issues, the USGS made a detailed assessment of groundwater availability of the Central Valley aquifer system, which includes: (1) the present status of groundwater resources; (2) characterization of how these resources have changed over time; and (3) tools to assess system responses to stresses from future human uses and climate variability and change. This effort builds on previous investigations, such as the USGS Central Valley Regional Aquifer System and Analysis (CV-RASA) project and several other groundwater studies in the Valley completed by Federal, State and local agencies at various scales. Data from these previous studies were the foundation of the Central Valley geospatial database. These and other data were re-examined through a series of regional-scale hydrologic investigations to provide updated and spatially consistent interpretations for the Central Valley Groundwater Availability study. In some cases, new data were collected to augment existing information. Data compiled from the studies include geology (in particular, borehole lithology and the extent and thickness of the Corcoran Clay Member of the Tulare Formation), topography, remote sensing, climate (precipitation and temperature), geophysics, vegetation and land use, vegetation properties, hydrology (stream network and flows), groundwater levels, subsidence, chemistry, and soils.  Digital elevation models, geologic maps, borehole information, cross sections, and other 3-dimensional models were used to develop the texture model which represents the properties and geometry of the Central Valley alluvial deposits. The resulting geospatial database supports characterization and conceptualization of the Central Valley hydrologic system between 1961 and 2003, construction of 3-dimensional hydrogeologic framework and hydrologic flow models, and visualization of analysis and model results.</supplinf>

<procdesc>From the available well records in the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) and California Department of Water Resources databases, a subset of comparison wells (206) was selected on the basis of perforation depths, completeness of record, climatic intervals, and locations throughout the Central Valley. Wells are identified and numbered according to their location in the rectangular system for the subdivision of public lands and this ID was taken from the respective database.</procdesc>
